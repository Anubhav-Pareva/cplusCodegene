	<h2>What is C++?</h2>
	<p>
		<pre>
			<ul>
<li>C++ is a cross-platformed language that can be used to create sophisticated high-performance applications.</li>

<li>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs in 1979, as an extension to the C language.</li>

<li>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</li>

<li>The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</li>
</ul></pre></p>
<h2>Why Use C++</h2>
<p><pre>
	<ul>
<li>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</li>

<li>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</li>

<li>C++ is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</li>

<li>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</li>

<li>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</li>

<li>As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa</li>
</ul>
</pre></p>
<h2>C++ Get Started</h2>
<p><pre>
To start using C++, you need two things:
<ul>
<li>A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code</li>
<li>A compiler, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand</li>
</ul>
There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
</pre></p>
<h2>C++ Install IDE</h2>
<p><pre>
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.

Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.

<b>Note:</b> Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.

We will use <b>Code::Blocks</b> in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.

You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26">http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26</a>. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
</pre></p>
<h2>C++ Quickstart</h2>
<p><pre>
Let's create our first C++ file.

Open Codeblocks and go to <b>File > New > Empty File.</b>

Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp <b>(File > Save File as)</b>:

myfirstprogram.cpp
<div class="trycode">
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
</div>
Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters. For now, focus on how to run the code.

In Codeblocks, it should look like this:
<img src="images\codeblocks2.png">
Then, go to Build > Build and Run to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:
<div class="trycode">
Hello World!
Process returned 0 (0x0) execution time : 0.011 s
Press any key to continue.
</div>
<b>Congratulations!</b> You have now written and executed your first C++ program.
</pre></p>
<h2>C++ Syntax</h2>
<p><pre>
Let's break up the following code to understand it better:

Example
<div class="trycode>">
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
</div>
</pre></p>
<h2>Example explained</h2>
<p><pre>
Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.

Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

Don't worry if you don't understand how #include <iostream> and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.

Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space.

Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.

Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".

Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.

Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }

Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.

Line 6: return 0 ends the main function.
</pre></p>
<h2>Omitting Namespace</h2>
<p><pre>
You might see some C++ programs that runs without the standard namespace library. The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for some objects:

Example
<div class="trycode">
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
</div>
It is up to you if you want to include the standard namespace library or not.
